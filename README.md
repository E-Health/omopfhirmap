# omopfhirmap

## About

Omopfhirmap is a command-line tool for mapping a [OHDSI](https://www.ohdsi.org/) cohort, defined in [ATLAS](http://www.ohdsi.org/web/atlas/), to a FHIR bundle that can be optionally submitted to a FHIR server for processing. Conversely, it can process a FHIR bundle and add resources to an existing CDM database ignoring duplicates. Unlike [GT-FHIR2, the OMOP on FHIR Project at Georgia Tech](http://omoponfhir.org/) omopfhirmap does not expose OMOP database as FHIR endpoints. 

## Use cases

* To export a cohort to a FHIR based analytics tool.
* To load new resources to OMOP CDM databases for incremental ETL.

## Build

```
mvn clean package

```

## Usage

* Work in progress

```shell script
java -jar <omopfhirmap.jar> <function> <source> <destination>

```

## Design

* JAVA >=13
* FHIR R4
* Multi-Threaded
* Uses spring-boot and JPA for wiring of services and abstraction of database.
